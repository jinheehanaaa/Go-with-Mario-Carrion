# REST
- HTTP Methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Be aware of underfetching problem (Might need to pull more info)
- Be aware of overfetching problem (Might not need all the data)
- EX: goa, go-swagger, oapi-codegen
# GraphQL
- Schema definition language (Types, Queries, and Mutations)
- You get what you want (No overfetching)
- Strongly Typed (ex: int, string, etc)
- Complex Backend Querying
- Caching is much more complex
- EX: graphql, gqlgen
# gRPC
- Binary format for communication (Protocol Buffer)
- Fast
- Difficult to implement
- No browser support
- EX: grpc-go, protoc, buf
